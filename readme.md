# Fraud Detection System

Machine learning–based credit card fraud detection system using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world anonymized data and handles extreme class imbalance.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Classifier (improved fraud recall)

## Evaluation
Models were evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle  
(Dataset not included due to size and licensing constraints.)

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fraud_detection.py
